# Mond
Mond is a proxy and this is a frontend for Mond
 
## Issues?
- When you can't set the proxy systemwide (pressing connect) you can also just set your browser proxy to `127.0.0.1` and port `4600` on the SOCKS5 protocol
- Not downloading the executable? Download the executable from https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/682847620112318472/853560429468581908/mond.exe and place it in the same directory as mond-gui
